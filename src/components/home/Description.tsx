            <p>Traveling or moving during COVID is such a tough decision to make! 
            It's not easy to understand the COVID situation in a specific place inside the US as there is alot of confusing information.
            'Is COVID There?' aims to present the spread of COVID-19 and vaccination data in an easy and user friendly manner. In the COVID section, there is also  additional information about communities for each county in the US.</p>

            <p>This app has up-to-date information from Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</p>

            <p>Please note that the recommendation during COVID is to stay home and not to travel, but in case of extreme emergency, we do hope 'Is COVID There?' will help in making the best decision for moving or traveling.</p>

            <p>Please stay safe!</p>
