# Is Covid There?

Traveling or moving during COVID is such a tough decision to make! It's not easy to understand the COVID situation in a specific place inside the US as there are lots of confusing information.

'Is COVID There?' aims to present the spread of COVID-19 and vaccination data using up-to-date information from the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in an easy and user-friendly manner.

Please keep in mind, the recommendation during COVID is to stay home and not to travel. But in case of extreme emergency, we do hope that 'Is COVID There?' will help in making the best decision for moving or traveling.

Please stay safe!
